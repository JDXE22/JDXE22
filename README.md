# Hi there, fellas!

I'm David Esparza, a sofware developer based in Colombia.

I create software that supports my learning process and even helps me in my day-to-day life.

If there’s a task or process that is not working efficiently, chances are I’ll create a way to improve it and put it into use.

My main tech stack is more backend-focused, but don’t be fooled—I also find building well-designed front ends interesting. The languages I use are JavaScript and TypeScript. My favorite tools are NestJS, React, Next.js, Node.js, and Tailwind. I’ve also used Bootstrap, Ant Design, and CSS for design in the past. For testing, I’m familiar with unit and e2e tests using Jest.

Soon you will see more projects pinned but my favorite is [Vets4Pets](https://github.com/JDXE22/Front-PF-VetsForPets). In case you are interested here below you have the deploy link:
