# Hi there, fellas!

I'm David Esparza, a sofware developer based in Colombia.

I create software that supports my learning process and even helps me in my day-to-day life.

If there’s a task or process that is not working efficiently, chances are I’ll create a way to improve it and put it into use.

My main tech stack is more backend-focused, but don’t be fooled—I also find building well-designed front ends interesting. The languages I use are JavaScript and TypeScript. My favorite tools are NestJS, React, Next.js, Node.js, and Tailwind. I’ve also used Bootstrap, Ant Design, and CSS for design in the past. For testing, I’m familiar with unit and e2e tests using Jest.

Soon you’ll see more projects pinned, but my favorite is [Vets4Pets](https://github.com/JDXE22/Front-PF-VetsForPets), where I had the role of backend software developer. In case you’re interested, below you’ll find the deployment link:

I’ve built more private than public repositories because I like to stay up to date and explore ideas when working with new technologies or concepts. Currently, I am learning AWS operations and best coding practices. Currently, I am working on my first portfolio, and I am really excited because it is soon to be released.
